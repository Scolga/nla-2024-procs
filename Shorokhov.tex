% The preparation of the article is based on the standard llncs class
% (Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences), which is adjusted with style
% file of the conference.
%
% There are two ways of compilation of the file into PDF
% 1. Use pdfLaTeX (pdflatex), (LaTeX+DVIPS will not work);
% 2. Use LuaLaTeX (XeLaTeX will work too).
% When using LuaLaTeX You will need TTF or OTF CMU fonts
% (Computer Modern Unicode). The fonts are installed with 'cm-unicode' package in
% a distribution of LaTeX % (https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm-unicode),
% either by downloading and installing these fonts system wide, the address of their page is
% http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/%7Epanov/cm-unicode/
% The second option won't work in XeLaTeX.
%
% For MiKTeX (LaTeX distribution for Windows),
%  1. Package 'cm-unicode' is installed manually with the MiKTeX administration Console.
%  2. For the compilation of this example, namely, the stub figure, one will also need to
% download package 'pgf' manually. This package uses in the popular
% package tikz.
%  3. Tests showed that the rest of the required packages MiKTeX loads automatically (if
%     it is allowed). The 'auto download' option is
%     configured in 'Settings' section in MiKTeX Console.
%
%
% The easiest way to compile an article is to use pdfLaTeX, but
% the final layout of the book will be compiled with LuaLaTeX,
% as a result will be of better quality thanks to the package 'microtype' and
% use vector OTF instead of standard raster fonts of pdfLaTeX.
%
% In the case of questions and problems with the article compilation,

\section{Variational formulation of boundary value problem}

It is well known that neural networks can successfully approximate the solutions of boundary value problems for partial differential equations (PDE) by forcing the neural network output to satisfy the PDE, boundary conditions and known physical laws, if any, using the correspondent residual functional when training the neural network \cite{Raissi2019}. 
 
We study the problem of constructing a loss functional based on a quasi-classical variational formulation \cite{Filippov1994} to train a neural network for the following boundary value problem for wave PDE

\begin{equation}
u_{tt}-u_{xx}=0,\,\left(x,\,t\right)\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}
\label{eq:wavePDE}
\end{equation}
in the rectangular area $\Omega=\left[0,\,l\right]\times\left[0,\,T\right]$ with boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
\left\{ \begin{aligned}u\left|_{t=0}\right.=\, & \chi_{1}\left(x\right),\,0\leq x\leq l,\,\\
u_{x}\left|_{x=l}\right.=\, & \varphi_{2}\left(t\right),\,0\leq t\leq T,\\
u_{t}\left|_{x=l}\right.=\, & \psi_{2}\left(t\right),\,0\leq t\leq T,\\
u_{x}\left|_{t=T}\right.=\, & \varphi_{3}\left(x\right),\,0\leq x\leq l,\,\\
u_{t}\left|_{t=T}\right.=\, & \psi_{3}\left(x\right),\,0\leq x\leq l,\,\\
u_{x}\left|_{x=0}\right.=\, & \varphi_{4}\left(t\right),\,0\leq t\leq T\\
u_{t}\left|_{x=0}\right.=\, & \psi_{4}\left(t\right),\,0\leq t\leq T.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\label{eq:wavePDE_bc}
\end{equation}
We assume that functions on the right sides of \eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc} are smooth $L_{2}$-functions and the boundary conditions \eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc} are consistent.

We prove the following statement  for the boundary value problem \eqref{eq:wavePDE}-\eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc} using the symmetrizing operator approach by V.M. Shalov \cite{Shalov1965}.

\begin{theorem}
The variational functional for the boundary value problem \eqref{eq:wavePDE}-\eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc}  can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
D\left[u\right]=\intop_{\Omega}\left(u_{x}^{2}+u_{t}^{2}-u_{x}\left(\nu+\mu\right)-u_{t}\left(\nu-\mu\right)\right)\,dxdt+\intop_{0}^{l}\left(u^{2}-2\chi_{1}u\right)\left|_{t=0}\right.dx,
\label{eq:wavePDE_func}
\end{equation}
where the functions $\mu,\,\nu$ are defined in area $\Omega$ according to the following formulas:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mu\left(x,\,t\right) & =\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{2}\left(-x+t+l\right)-\psi_{2}\left(-x+t+l\right)\right), & x-t>l-T,\\
\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{3}\left(x-t+l\right)-\psi_{3}\left(x-t+l\right)\right), & x-t\leq l-T,
\end{cases}\\
\nu\left(x,\,t\right) & =\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{3}\left(x+t-T\right)+\psi_{3}\left(x+t-T\right)\right), & x+t>T,\\
\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{4}\left(x+t\right)+\psi_{4}\left(x+t\right)\right), & x+t\leq T.
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Functional \eqref{eq:wavePDE_func} contains first-order derivatives of the function $u$ and can be estimated using the Monte Carlo integration method.

\section{Training neural network with variational functional}

When training a deep neural network for a boundary value problem, the residual functional is generally used as a loss functional \cite{Raissi2019}. 
When using the residual functional for the problem  \eqref{eq:wavePDE}-\eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc},
it is necessary to evaluate five integrals (over area $\Omega$ and over four parts of its boundary $\partial\Omega$)  and calculate partial derivatives of $u$ up to the second order, inclusive.
When using the quasi-classical functional \eqref{eq:wavePDE_func},  one has to evaluate two integrals (over $\Omega$ and a part of $\partial\Omega$) and calculate first order derivatives of $u$.

Computational experiments on training neural networks for the boundary value problem \eqref{eq:wavePDE}-\eqref{eq:wavePDE_bc} using the residual functional and the constructed quasi-classical functional \eqref{eq:wavePDE_func} as a loss functional demonstrate that when using the quasi-classical functional, the neural network training occurs approximately three times faster with the achievement of significantly higher quality metrics.

Thus, the quasi-classical variational functional can have a number of advantages over the residual functional when training a neural network for a boundary value problem.
