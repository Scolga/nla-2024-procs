\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Abstract:} This paper is concerned with the well-posedness and controllability of semilinear impulsive stochastic functional evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. The existence and uniqueness of mild solutions are proved under suitable assumptions. We establish sufficient conditions for the finite-approximate controllability of such systems with non-Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients using Picard-type iterations. An application involving the impulse effect associated with the delay is presented to verify our claimed results.

\section{The main results}
Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for semilinear impulsive stochastic functional evolution equations with the help of the fixed point theorem. Then, We present sufficient conditions for the finite-approximate controllability of semilinear impulsive stochastic functional evolution systems in Hilbert spaces under non-Lipschitz conditions satisfied by the nonlinear drift and diffusion coefficients depending on the control using the Picard approximation method and semigroup property, under the assumption of approximate controllability of the associated linear stochastic system via stochastic resolvent-like operators 
$(\epsilon(I-\pi \mathop{\mathbb{E}(\cdot)})+\Pi^T_{0})^{-1}$. Our results have improved and extended some relevant results in this area.
