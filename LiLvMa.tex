% The preparation of the article is based on the standard llncs class
% (Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences), which is adjusted with style
% file of the conference.
%
% There are two ways of compilation of the file into PDF
% 1. Use pdfLaTeX (pdflatex), (LaTeX+DVIPS will not work);
% 2. Use LuaLaTeX (XeLaTeX will work too).
% When using LuaLaTeX You will need TTF or OTF CMU fonts
% (Computer Modern Unicode). The fonts are installed with 'cm-unicode' package in
% a distribution of LaTeX % (https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm-unicode),
% either by downloading and installing these fonts system wide, the address of their page is
% http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/%7Epanov/cm-unicode/
% The second option won't work in XeLaTeX.
%
% For MiKTeX (LaTeX distribution for Windows),
%  1. Package 'cm-unicode' is installed manually with the MiKTeX administration Console.
%  2. For the compilation of this example, namely, the stub figure, one will also need to
% download package 'pgf' manually. This package uses in the popular
% package tikz.
%  3. Tests showed that the rest of the required packages MiKTeX loads automatically (if
%     it is allowed). The 'auto download' option is
%     configured in 'Settings' section in MiKTeX Console.
%
%
% The easiest way to compile an article is to use pdfLaTeX, but
% the final layout of the book will be compiled with LuaLaTeX,
% as a result will be of better quality thanks to the package 'microtype' and
% use vector OTF instead of standard raster fonts of pdfLaTeX.

% Further instructions are in the text body of the template. The template itself

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report focuses on pore-scale modeling of generalized Newtonian fluid flow in porous media using asymptotic homogenization methods.
Local problems on periodic cells are derived to describe the local transport of generalized Newtonian fluids in pores.
The permeability tensor of generalized Newtonian fluids is obtained based on the theoretical analysis of local problems and is proved to be symmetric and positive definite.
A least squares finite element numerical solution of the local problem is developed with the help of the physical properties of the microscopic pore structure.
Solving the local problem determines the accurate distribution of velocity, pressure, and non-Newtonian viscosity in a single pore, as well as evaluating the permeability coefficient and effective viscosity.
Simulation results of Carreau-Yasuda fluid microflow in three-dimensional porous ceramics validate the proposed mathematical model and numerical method.

\section{The main results}


The non-Newtonian flow in porous medium has attracted much attention due to its important role in composite materials and petroleum industry.
However, due to the spatial multi-scale of porous medium and the rheological properties of fluids, this flow mechanism is very complex.
In this study, the asymptotic homogenization method is applied to pore-scale modeling of generalized Newtonian fluid flow in porous media.
Local problems on periodic cells are derived to describe the local transport of generalized Newtonian fluids in pores.
Based on the theoretical analysis of local problems, the permeability tensor of generalized Newtonian fluid is obtained and proved to be symmetric and positive definite, as shown in Theorem 1 below:

\textbf{Theorem 1.}
\textsl{The solution $V_{i}^{(j)}$ of the local problem has the following
relationship with the local problem:
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle \langle v_{i}^{(0)}\rangle = K_{i}^{j}
\frac{g_{j}-p_{,x_{j}}^{(0)}}{|g_{j}-p_{,x_{j}}^{(0)}|},
\end{equation*}
where $K_{i}^{j}=\int_{\Omega_{yf}}V_{i}^{(j)}d\mathbf{y}$ is the permeability tensor
and $K_{i}^{j}$ is symmetric positive definite.
Since $V_{i}^{(j)}(\mathbf{y},|g_{j}-p^{(0)}_{,x_{j}}|)$ are nonlinear vector functions,
in fact the tensor $K_{i}^{j}(|g_{j}-p^{(0)}_{,x_{j}}|)$ is is
a symmetric positive definite tensor composed of nonlinear tensor functions.}

A least squares finite element numerical solution for local problems has been developed based on the physical properties of microscopic pore structures.
The solution of local problems can not only determine the accurate distribution of velocity, pressure and non Newtonian viscosity in a single hole, but also evaluate the permeability coefficient and effective viscosity of generalized Newtonian fluid in porous medium.
The micro flow of Carreau-Yasuda fluid in three-dimensional porous ceramics was simulated, and the proposed mathematical model and numerical method were validated.
