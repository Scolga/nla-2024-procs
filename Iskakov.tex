\begin{abstract}
We consider a class of systems of nonlinear non-autonomous differential equations with distributed delay. For this class of systems, the Lyapunov~-- Krasovskii functional is proposed, with the help of which it is possible to obtain sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the zero solution, estimates of the norms of solutions that characterize the rate of decrease, and estimates of the attraction set.

%\section{The main results} %optional section


We consider the systems of differential equations with distributed delay of the following form 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = A(t)y(t)
+\int\limits^t_{-\infty}B(t,t-s)y(s)ds
+F\left(t,y(t),\int\limits^t_{-\infty}y(s)ds\right),
\eqno(1)
$$
where 
$A(t)$ is a
$(n\times n)$-matrix with continuous real-valued
$T$-periodic entires, 
$B(t,s)$ is a
$(n\times n)$-matrix with continuous real-valued
$T$-periodic with respect to the first variable entires, i.e.,
$$
A(t)\equiv A(t+T),\quad
B(t,s)\equiv B(t+T,s), 
$$ 
$F(t,u_1,u_2)$ is a continuous real-valued vector-funcion. We assume that 
$F(t,u_1,u_2)$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to $u_1$, $u_2$ and satisfies the inequality
$$
\|F(t,u_1,u_2)\|\le q \|u_1\|^{1+\omega},
\quad t>0, 
\quad u_1,u_2\in\mathbb{R}^n,
$$
with $q,\omega>0$.

The Lyapunov~-- Krasovskii functional proposed in [2] is used to study the stability of the zero solution of system (1): 
$$
v(t,y) = \langle H(t)y(t),
y(t)\rangle
 +\int\limits^\infty_0 \int\limits^t_{t-\eta}
 \langle K(t-s,\eta)y(s), y(s) \rangle \, dsd\eta.
$$
This functional is an analog of the Lyapunov~-- Krasovskii functional from the [1].

Using this functional, we obtain sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the 
zero solution to system (1) in terms of matrix and integral inequalities, establish estimates of the norms 
of solutions that characterize the rate of decrease, and estimates of the attraction set.
